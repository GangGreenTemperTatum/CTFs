* This walkthrough does not explain the full concepts of the vulnerabilities used for exploits and assumes knowledge of the techniques as a pre-requisite to attempting the CTF.

## Additional Resources:
- Review or download the [**How to play GitLab's Capture the Flag at home** GitLab blog](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/08/12/how-to-play-gitlab-ctf-at-home/)

## Setup Instructions:

- Ensure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is setup on your localhost
  > **Note**, from experience this lab will work in an isolated air-gapped environment but may fail when is comes to DNS requests
- I'd recommend ensuring you have a web proxy, [Postman](https://postman.com) and [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/) tools setup as tools, but additional internet access may help you with downloading tools from other repo's that you discover are needed during the challenges. 
- I'll be demonstrating my walkthrough using different examples and techniques of them all to mix it up.
  > **Note**, when using a tool such as Burp Suite to manipulate, proxy and send web requests to the application, you are most likely going to need to URL-encode the values sent (unless performed by default) as they would naturally when you emulate a user on the frontend [HAPPY-path](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part1/happy-path.html#:~:text=Also%20known%20as%20the%20%22sunny,the%20user's%20or%20caller's%20goal.) regular browsing session or experience.

# Methodologies and Attack Vectors

## SSRF (Server Side Request Forgery)
### [Sea-Surf Challenge](http://capture.local.thetanuki.io/sea-surf) **1**:

* Sea-Surf challenges 1-3 are SSRF-based (Server Side Request Forgery).
- There are 3 different challenges, each with an increasing level of input url validation.
- I'll demonstrate these "easier" challenges in the browser by happy-path.

- SSRF-based attacks provide a follow-on mechanim(s) for further manipulation or exploits. However, ultimately in this lab our aim is to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.
- Let's try the server itself:

`http://127.0.0.1`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104169244/229268239-43aa0548-0006-4c19-b4df-e8b55a1245b6.png)

- From the error `Error: Head http://127.0.0.1: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:80: connect: connection refused`, its clear that the connectivity is permitted but on the wrong layer-4 TCP port.
- We could use a tool such as the [Burp Suite Intruder](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder#:~:text=Burp%20Intruder%20is%20a%20tool,into%20predefined%20positions%20each%20time.) to enumerate TCP ports 0-65535 as a spray of individual HTTP POST requests to identify the permitted port's if any.
- Another alternate approach could be to look for another commonly used HTTP port such as NGINX default:

`http://127.0.0.1:8080`

### [See-Surf Challenge](http://capture.local.thetanuki.io/sea-surf) **2**:

- Let's switch gears and try a redirect to the same localhost which we know is exploitable with SSRF via `http://127.0.0.1:8080` since as though our initial attempt from challenge 1 obviously fails.
- Searching for repo's such as [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=ssrf+payloads) for "SSRF Payloads", or even a Google Dork for "SSRF to localhost redirect" returns a plethora of templates of payloads in which again we could use a tool like [Burp Suite Intruder](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder#:~:text=Burp%20Intruder%20is%20a%20tool,into%20predefined%20positions%20each%20time.) to enumerate a barrage of HTTP POST request's with unique SSRF redirect payloads, example from [Hahwul](https://www.hahwul.com/phoenix/ssrf-open-redirect/)'s fantastic cheatsheet:

`?url=http://127.0.0.1:8080`

<img width="1217" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104169244/229268317-8236f3d3-38ff-4785-8ef5-e8befa8cb2d9.png">

- No dice.. and `Error: invalid url format` (using either IPv4 loopback or FQDN of `localhost` as well as the FQDN itself `ssrf2.local.thetanuki.io`) tells us that input validation coded into the web application is preventing this connection.
- How about using an external redirect service you say?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104169244/229268341-6835bdbc-ff3d-49ae-8847-ac6528a070fd.png)

* There are a few tools we could use to manipulate, create and validate our own external redirect service with one popular option to mention is [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/).
   - Here's a great follow-up blog on [Ngrok for Penetration Testerâ€™s](https://medium.com/geekculture/ngrok-for-penetration-testers-78761ba0d02) that explains on how to build a service or listener.
   - I'd recommend [FRP](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) as a base project if your looking for something open-source and could even create an immutable template from in your own cloud infrastructure for an on-demand, self-managed approach which you can also boster with your own additional security controls.
> **Note**, all network requests (and sometimes more) for commercialized tools are normally logged. **You should never be without consent or a clear agreement to engage**.

- An easy approach would be to use a service such as [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/), [Tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com) or other external redirect service that we can use to create a URL shortener that ultimately points to localhost.
- Bitly won't let us specify `localhost` here, but will accept IPv4 addresses which we can use to represent 
  - Note, the generated shorted URL will be unique each time.

### [Si-Surf Challenge](http://capture.local.thetanuki.io/sea-surf) **3**:

- Building on our knowledge and experience gained from challenges 1 and 2 as well as mulling some initial hypothesises, I looked into a DNS rebinding attack to circumvent what seems to show the web application's working input sanitization of the `url` parameter. 
  - This is where the application will use a short TTL (time-to-live) to resolve `localhost` (itself) as the first IPv4 address and a public (external) IPv4 address for me to perform another external-redirect-based SSRF attack.
  - I initially turned to a good old friend in [nip.io](https://nip.io/) which was missing the (_IP_) notiation I was looking for after admittingley prioritizing others like hexadecimal, decimal and octal which didn't hit lucky red for me in this case. 

- I performed a Google search for "_DNS Rebinding Service_" and found Tavis Ormandy's fantastic DNS rebinding server tool [rbndr](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/rebinder.html) ([rbndr Git](https://github.com/taviso/rbndr)).
  - I.E, an example payload using `127.0.0.1` as the first IPv4 address and `1.1.1.1` (randomly chosen) as the second IPv4 address provides me:

`http://7f000001.01010101.rbndr.us:8080`

If the address doesnâ€™t make sense, that is hexadecimal notation for the internal IPv4 address and then the public IPv4 address, followed by `rbndr.us:8080`.
<br>
  > **The hostname generated will resolve randomly to one of the addresses specified with a very low TTL (Time-To-Live).**

`http://7f000001.01010101.rbndr.us:8080`

  > `7f000001` (Hex format) = `127.0.0.1` (IPv4 dotted decimal format)
  
  > `01010101` (Hex format) = `1.1.1.1` (IPv4 dotted decimal format)


  > - ðŸ§  **Hint**, try `ping 7f000001` from your host to test what you see.
  
  > **Note**, depending on the TTL of the DNS request you may get a cached response and therefore may have to run this a few times and give it some time.
